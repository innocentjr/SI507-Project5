History: 
""Santacon wasn’t always a charitable event, or even a drinking party. It began in San Francisco in 1994 as a performant art piece intended “to make whimsical fun” of the commercialism surrounding Christmas, founder John Law told the Village Voice in 2014. That year, 34 participants clad in Santa suits marched through San Francisco gatecrashing parties and looking for other ways to “shock people,” Law said.
The event has become somewhat different in tone and purpose, transforming from a spectacle to, well, a drunken spectacle. The Christmas-focused day-drinking event has annoyed everyone from police officers to bartenders, some of which forbid people from entering their establishments on Santacon if they’re wearing a costume. "" By Kerry Close

Historic Chicago Walking Bar Tour,"Hours of Operation:
Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 5:45pm
Walking Tour: Historical Pub Crawl
On this Chicago pub crawl with an educational twist, you’ll explore Chicago’s entertainment history and learn about prohibition, jazz, theater, vices, and social clubs. Guests interact with historic photos and videos on shared iPads and visit historic buildings for three drink stops. We don’t walk far on our evening walking tour, which gives us more time to engage with Chicago history and look at architecture. And of course our limited walking on the tour allows us to enjoy our appetizers and choice of wine or beer.
Tour groups see magnificent lobbies and really engage with some beautiful historic architecture. Many tour guests enjoy the social dynamic of this unique tour. Solo travelers often join the tour, and as a great Chicago date idea, it’s a fun thing to do with your boyfriend or girlfriend. Groups of friends make the tour into a cool weekend event as it’s more than a Chicago pub crawl – you’ll eat, drink, and learn about architecture, Prohibition-era history, and culture.
We’d like to say it’s a Speakeasy Tour or a Chicago Prohibition Tour, but truthfully very few bars in Chicago remaining today were ever speakeasies, and only one of our stops on our tour was a speakeasy in the true sense of the word. The Historic Chicago Bar Walking Tour is like a mix of a food tour, an architecture walking tour, and a mobile documentary film. Book your tour early as the historic Chicago bar tour pub crawl often sells out. It’s a unique Chicago thing to do this summer!
The tour includes: Engaging tour guide commentary, Shared use of iPads with historic photos and video clips, Gift packets, and Appetizers.
Walking tour ticket does not include drinks and server gratuities. All guests must choose a beverage for the tour and bring cash to cover 2.5 servings of beer ($20), wine ($22), soda ($6), or water ($3).
Walking Distance: 1.2 miles
Duration: 2.5 hours
MEETING POINT - Be sure to print the map of our meeting point. We meet inside Argo Tea at 435 N. Michigan Ave, which is Tribune Tower. Look for the guide with the name tag and clipboard. We make a circle so that the tour ends one block north of our starting point at Intercontinental Hotel, 505 N. Michigan Ave.
CASH FOR DRINKS - Each guest must choose a beverage option ($20 for beer or wine, $6 for soda, $3 for water). Covers 2 regular size drinks, 1 sample-size drink, and server gratuities on the drinks and the appetizers (apps are included in the tour). In order to keep the tour efficient for servers and to streamline the tour for your enjoyment, everyone sticks to their choice of one beverage for all three stops. First 10 minutes of the tour is mandatory check-in.
PARKING - If you are driving, we offers our guests a special discounted rate for parking at the Grant Park North Garage, accessible from Michigan Avenue at Randolph Street.. Rate is $15 ($38 value), valid up to 12 hours. Upon check-in for the tour, ask the tour guide for a voucher for the discounted rate. This is four to five blocks from the tour start and end locations.

Information on the Chicago Dancemakers Forum Lab Artist Awards Program and application tips.
Co-hosted by Chicago Park District and Move Me Soul. 
Chicago Dancemakers Forum launches its 15th Anniversary year with a series of public dialogues about envisioning the future of Chicago Dance in relationship to its past: an opportunity to share what we are envisioning and an opportunity to hear what people want from Chicago Dancemakers Forum. The discussion also includes information and application insights on the signature Lab Artist Awards program, a $15,000 cash grant combined with a year of mentorship to support the research, development and performance of a newly choreographed work. http://www.chicagodancemakers.org",75,39189421615,5004,21762696,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/innovation-in-chicago-dance-contemporary-makers-tickets-39189421615?aff=ebapi
